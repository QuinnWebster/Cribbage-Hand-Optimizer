This is the **first website** I built—a fun project to dive into **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and **CSS**.  

### Inspiration  
The idea came while playing a game of cribbage. I thought, *why not write an algorithm to find the best cards to keep for any given hand?*  

After developing the algorithm, I learned some HTML to create a user interface so I could share the project with others.  

### How It Works  
1. The user selects the **six cards** they were dealt.  
2. They indicate whether it’s their **crib**.  
3. The program determines the **best four cards to keep** and which to "get rid of."
   

Try it out next time you play a game of cribbage!
